The YeastPhosphoAtlas represents a systematic effort to understand the dynamic regulation of the
*S. cerevisiae* phosphoproteome accross a diverse range of environmental and chemical perturbations.
In this web portal, you can explore the regulation of your favorite sites and discover which conditions
are most likely to cause differential phosphorylation. We hope this serves as a guide to quickly
build validation assays and discover new biology.

### How to use:

Under our `Expression Profiles` panel, you can search for your protein of interest by
[SGD](https://www.yeastgenome.org/) accession. Once you have chosen a protein, you can
take a look through the list of detected sites within our data. Selecting a site will
then allow you to view its regulation accross conditions. If you would only like to see
the expression of your protein of interest in a subset of condtions, use the checkboxes
to build your ideal set.
